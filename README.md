# Real-time-image-classifier
Artificial Neural Network that recognizes objects using the webcam
An image dataset is collected with the webcam
- a neural network from scratch
- training of the neural network 
- processing the images to be used in a machine learning model
- using a pre-trained neural network to make predictions of images 
- fine-tuning of the pre-trained network
